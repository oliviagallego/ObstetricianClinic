## Aim
This project develops a database for a fictional obstetrician's clinic as a capstone for our database course. It demonstrates our ability to design and manage complex database systems effectively.

## Why This Theme?
We selected an obstetrician's clinic to simulate a database environment with complex data relationships and strict data integrity needs, typical of medical settings. This project allowed us to apply our theoretical knowledge to a practical scenario, emphasizing real-world applicability and technical challenges.

## Development Process
Our project followed the Scrum framework, ensuring a collaborative and iterative approach to development. Key stages included:
1. **Use Case and Requirements Elicitation**: Initially, we defined use cases and collected detailed requirements to shape the project's goals and scope.
2. **Entity-Relationship (E-R) Diagram**: We designed an E-R diagram to map out entity relationships, crucial for structuring our database schema.
3. **Database Tables**: Based on our E-R diagram, we created and normalized database tables to efficiently store and manage data.
4. **Mock-ups**: Preliminary UI mock-ups were crafted to visualize the end-user interaction with the database.
5. **Programming**: We implemented the database and user interface using Java, SQL, XML, and HTML, integrating multiple technologies to build a robust system.
